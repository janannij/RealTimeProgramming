Exercise 2 - Choice of language
-----------------------------
> After doing this exercise, I have learned about message-passing which is convenient when dealing with multiple threads. As this is a multi-elevator project I believe this will be suitable. I think I will be using concurrency as there are multiple elevators, but only one common queue system. 

> In previous projects I have been splitting programs into functions and objects as modules. I have experienced that this works well, so I may use this method now as well. I haven’t thought much about which modules I will create, but I believe we will be needing one for hardware, queue system, orders and states at least. 

> In exercise 3 I was introduced for UDP and TCP and I think these are suitable for the networking part. As these exists in the Go-library (and the exercise was done in Go), Go is a strong candidate for choice of language. 

> Go has a package «testing» which may be used during testing. But as testing of multithreaded code is difficult, we may have to create some tests ourselves. 

> Since many of the exercises are done in Go and Go goes well with the points discussed above, I believe Go is a good choice of language in the project.
